## General info

> People come to React from different backgrounds and with different learning styles. Whether you prefer a more theoretical or a practical approach, we hope youâ€™ll find this section helpful.
If you prefer to learn by doing, start with our [practical tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

I'm that person and thats's why this repository exists.

## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- React 17.0
- npm

# TODO

>If you have extra time or want to practice your new React skills, here are some ideas for improvements that you could make to the tic-tac-toe game which are listed in order of increasing difficulty:

- :x: Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
- :x: Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
- :x: Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- :x: Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- :x: When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
- :x: When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
